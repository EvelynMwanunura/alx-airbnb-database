1.  Run EXPLAIN
    EXPLAIN
    SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price AS booking_total_price,
    b.status AS booking_status,
        u.user_id,
        u.first_name,
        u.last_name,
        u.email,

        p.property_id,
        p.name AS property_name,
        p.location,
        p.price_per_night,

        pay.payment_id,
        pay.amount AS payment_amount,
        pay.payment_date,
        pay.payment_method

FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;

2. What to Look for in the EXPLAIN Output

type

ALL → full table scan → inefficient.

ref, eq_ref, const → more efficient.

key

Should show which index is being used for the join or WHERE filter.

rows

Shows how many rows are scanned. Fewer is better.

Extra

Look for Using temporary or Using filesort → can indicate slow sorting.

3. Potential Inefficiencies in This Query

Joins on non-indexed columns

Booking.user_id → should have an index (already suggested: idx_booking_user_id).

Booking.property_id → should have an index (idx_booking_property_id).

Payment.booking_id → should have an index (idx_payment_booking_id).

ORDER BY b.start_date DESC

If start_date is not indexed, MySQL may do a filesort, which is slower on large datasets.

Could add an index on Booking(start_date) for faster ordering.

LEFT JOIN Payment

If the Payment table is large and many bookings have no payment yet, scanning all rows may be slow.

4. Suggested Indexes to Improve Performance
   -- Already suggested indexes
   CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON Booking(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON Booking(property_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON Payment(booking_id);

-- Optional: speed up ORDER BY
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON Booking(start_date);
